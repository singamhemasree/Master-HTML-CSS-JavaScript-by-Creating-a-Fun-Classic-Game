📌 Tic Tac Toe Game using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This project is a fully functional Tic Tac Toe web game built using the core technologies of modern web development — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed especially for beginners who want to move beyond theory and gain hands-on experience by building a real-world interactive project from scratch.

Rather than focusing only on concepts, this project helps you understand how frontend technologies work together to create dynamic and responsive web applications. You’ll learn how to structure a webpage using HTML, style it using CSS, and implement game logic and interactivity with JavaScript.

Through this project, essential programming concepts such as variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and event handling are applied in a practical way by building a fun and interactive browser-based game.

By the end of this project, you will have a playable Tic Tac Toe game that you can customize, enhance, and share as part of your web development portfolio.
